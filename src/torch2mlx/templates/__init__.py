"""MLX implementations of standard architecture patterns.

These are hand-written MLX equivalents that replace auto-translation
of forward() logic. Each template covers a common pattern:
  - transformer: standard transformer block (attention + FFN)
  - cnn: convolutional stack patterns
  - mlp: feed-forward networks
